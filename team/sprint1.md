# Sprint # - *t23* - *Team Dave*

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *Josette Grinslade*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint#.md).
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *#41 Responsive Client for distance calculator*
* *#42 RESTful Service for distance*

*This being the first sprint, our team made a game plan for the sprint and how we expect each other to use github.
 We planned that we would be held accountable for not only ourselves but for each other. Abby would handle the API,
 Josette would create and implement the Calculate class and update the team's website, Le would be responsible for
 the conversions and Sam would provide the Distance class.*

## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *jhgrins*: *I completed the Calculate class that provided the necessary conversion between the Distance object and
             json. I also personalized the client for our team.*
* *kle*: *I completed Supported Units to support additional units for kilometers and/or nautical miles on top of miles.*
* *amrictor*: *I completed REST API framework which allowed additional requests to be posted, interpreted, and responded to by our webpage*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *jhgrins*: *For this sprint, I was able to complete all my tasks.*
* *kle*: *All my tasks were completed this Sprint*
* *amrictor*: *I completed all tasks*

#### What went well
* *We completed all tasks presented to us, and deployed a functional product which met the requirements for this sprint. Our team members are now more familiar with the codebase and with the development process, setting us up for a successful semester.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *something*
* *We had difficultly understading what was expected of us to complete for this sprint. We were able to over come this
   by working together and working through this new material. This was not surprising to us since this was our first
   sprint and it takes time to understand brand new materials, languages and concepts.*
* *To me, personally, I spent lots of time digging through the codes and not just the ones from my task but the entire tripco repo, as well as cloned and personalized repo, from server side to client side, and that was not rewarding. At the beginning of each file there is a small explaination but it was still hard to figured out which class does what sometimes. I also encountered lots of problem with really abstractive instructions, I have spent more time either figuring out what those instructions meant, or understood the instruction but does not know a way to follow it; than actually coding.*

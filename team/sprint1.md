# Sprint # - *t23* - *Team Dave*

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *Josette Grinslade*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint#.md).
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *#41 Responsive Client for distance calculator*
* *#42 RESTful Service for distance*

*This being the first sprint, our team made a game plan for the sprint and how we expect each other to use github.
 We planned that we would be held accountable for not only ourselves but for each other. Abby would handle the API,
 Josette would create and implement the Calculate class and update the team's website, Le would be responsible for
 the conversions and Sam would provide the Distance class.*

## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *user story*:  *comments*
* *jhgrins*: *I completed the Calculate class that provided the necessary conversion between the Distance object and
             json. I also personalized the client our team.*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *user story*: *explanation...*
* *jhgrins*: *For this sprint, I was able to complete all my tasks.*

#### What went well
* *something*
* *Our team was able to communicate well enough in slack that everyone was able to complete their tasks and have a
   succesful deployment.*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *something*
* *We had difficultly understading what was expected of us to complete for this sprint. We were able to over come this
   by working together and working through this new material. This was not surprising to us since this was our first
   sprint and it takes time to understand brand new materials, languages and concepts.*

# Sprint # - *t23* - *Team Dave*

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *Josette Grinslade*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint#.md).
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *#41 Responsive Client for distance calculator*
* *#42 RESTful Service for distance*

*This being the first sprint, our team made a game plan for the sprint and how we expect each other to use github.
 We planned that we would be held accountable for not only ourselves but for each other. Abby would handle the API,
 Josette would create and implement the Calculate class and update the team's website, Le would be responsible for
 the conversions and Sam would provide the Distance class.*

## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *user story*:  *comments*
* *jhgrins*: *I completed the Calculate class that provided the necessary conversion between the Distance object and
             json. I also personalized the client for our team.*
* *kle*: *I completed Supported Units to support additional units for kilometers and/or nautical miles on top of miles.*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog

* *jhgrins*: *For this sprint, I was able to complete all my tasks.*
* *kle*: *All my tasks were completed this Sprint*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *something*
* *We had difficultly understading what was expected of us to complete for this sprint. We were able to over come this
   by working together and working through this new material. As individual team members, we spent a lot of time digging through the code. We did not only look at the code from our tasks but the entire tripco repo. We got familar with cloning and personalizing repos, from server side to client side, which took up a good portion of our time. At the beginning of each file there was an explaination but it was still difficult at first to figure out the purpose of each class. We spent more time developing our understand than coding this sprint. However, this was not surprising to us since this was our first
   sprint and it takes time to understand new materials, languages and concepts.*
   

## Retrospective

#### What went well
**Our team was able to communicate well enough in slack that everyone was able to complete their tasks and have a
   successful deployment. The team members were really responsible and really invested their time on this class and this project that you can almost always find somebody talking about the project or working on their task on Slack.*

#### Potential improvements

#### What we will change next time

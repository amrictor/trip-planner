## Plan

*An introductory paragraph describing what you expect to accomplish this sprint with a list of epics that will achieve the goal.*

* #75 User: I want a map and itinerary for my trip: I plan trips in the state of Colorado in another tool. The tool produces a file that conforms to the TFFI trip object. The trip is always a round trip. Show me a map and itinerary for the trip in the file that I can view on my phone.
* #71 User: I want to supply my own units for the distances: I should be able to define an arbitrary unit of measure to use in the itinerary.
* #79 All code shall be clean!: Review all teammates code to be clean and consistent.

*Include a discussion of planning decisions.*

# Teamwork Questionnaire for Sam Westra

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is the best way to reach me. Any hours between 12am and 8am are good times.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I think we'll learn to work together within the context of sprints and GitHub
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I'm incredibly used to the independent work of the previous classes, I need to learn to better ask questions and collaborate when  I get stuck.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * We could come across issues where parts of an assignment might not be as fleshed out as others, or we may have issues pushing and pulling from Github at the same time. Making a cohesive project
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Some people will think errors are acceptable, others will not and the A folk may try to do more work to compensate
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think it depends entirely on how much more work that is. If it's simple fixes that are quick, then yes. But there should communication on both fronts about what work is being done
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * 7-8 hours
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * All it requires is some communication. Finding a way to split things up equally will require figuring out what parts of each project would require similar amounts of work. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * It'd be difficult at first, but following a lost grade, I think the consensus would be to speak with the manager about what could be done.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I would hope my team would be able to discuss it in a professional way, I'm always looking for criticism to get better at this work in general.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I'm actually more focused on improving my own work habits, so as long as people are working hard and getting things done, I dont mind.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Only if we think we really need it. I dont have many times to meet, but I will try to be available.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At most, once a week? It depends on how well we can communicate without face to face.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Generally, yes. Large decisions definitely. Smaller decisions that might not affect everyone could slide. Letting everyone know would be good regardless.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to see both sides of the argument and see if we can find a compromise for that one person if possible.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Ask that person to give up some of the work. But if only one person is making all decisions, I'd ask everyone during our meetings if they've got ideas.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * If the social aspect of the project starts to weigh on me too heavily, I'll talk with the team to see if we can't find a compromise.

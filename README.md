# Manifesto
### Communication Abby
### Flexibility
Our members value the ability to handle mishaps and failures as a team. As a teammate, it is important to handle unexpected events in a professional way and to communicate with each other. There will be hardships, but our team expects that each one of us will maintain a positive attitude and keep moving forward.
### Planning
Arguably one of the most important parts of a group project is the planning phase. Our team holds this as one of our values as it is the best way to work well together, minimize miscommunications, and to properly distribute work among the team. Having an effective plan lets every team member know what the other members are working on and towards, in order to best work cohesively towards a goal.
### Respect
A team would get nowhere without mutual respect towards each of the team members. We value this as a part of the process and intend to let everyone's concerns, ideas, and work be heard and seen equally. To be certain that everyone is working hard to complete this project, we want to be sure that our team doesn't fall apart in the time we are together.

# Expectations
### Learning focus Abby
### Readability
As a group, our team will be faced with several projects that require us to work together. We will work on code and projects together. To be succesful as an individual and as a teammate, we must be able to read each other's code. Everyone has a different coding style. That being said, we will strive to comment when appropriate and to write code that is easy enough to understand and not obscure.
### Clean code
In a lot of ways, our code can speak better for us than our voices can, if it's written well. We hope to write code in such a way that is effective and concise. Having effectively planned what sections of code can do, we should be able to avoid redundancy, errors, and issues that may arise later in the semester. Maximizing the dynamic aspect of different segments of code, we should be able to avoid restraints and rewrites as factors of the project change throughout the project.
### Check-ins (stand-ups)

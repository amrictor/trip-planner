# Manifesto
### Communication Abby
### Flexibility
Our members value the ability to handle mishaps and failures as a team. As a teammate, it is important to handle unexpected events in a professional way and to communicate with each other. There will be hardships, but our team expects that each one of us will maintain a positive attitude and keep moving forward.
### Planning Sam
### Respect

# Expectations
### Learning focus Abby
### Readability
As a group, our team will be faced with several projects that require us to work together. We will work on code and projects together. To be succesful as an individual and as a teammate, we must be able to read each other's code. Everyone has a different coding style. That being said, we will strive to comment when appropriate and to write code that is easy enough to understand and not obscure.
### Clean code Sam
### Check-ins (stand-ups)
